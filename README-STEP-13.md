# Step 13: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting Implementation

## Overview

Step 13 implements **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting** - a revolutionary technique that guides AI through step-by-step reasoning before providing final answers. This dramatically improves the quality and transparency of Only Explore's travel planning recommendations by making AI reasoning explicit and systematic.

## What is Chain-of-Thought Prompting?

Chain-of-Thought prompting works by explicitly instructing the AI to think through problems step-by-step, rather than jumping directly to conclusions. Instead of asking "Plan a 5-day trip to Himachal," we guide the AI to:

1. **Analyze requirements** (destination, duration, interests, budget, travel style)
2. **Identify constraints** and preferences
3. **Research activities** and attractions for their interests
4. **Consider logistics** (travel time, location proximity, seasonal factors)
5. **Allocate activities** across days for optimal flow
6. **Provide final structured** itinerary

This mimics human reasoning - we don't instantly know complex travel plans, we work through them systematically. CoT makes AI reasoning transparent and dramatically more reliable.

## Implementation Details

### Core Library (`src/lib/chain-of-thought.ts`)

```typescript
// Perform Chain-of-Thought reasoning
export async function performChainOfThought(config: CoTConfig): Promise<CoTResult>

// Detect optimal CoT task type
export function detectCoTTaskType(query: string): 'itinerary' | 'budget' | 'recommendations' | 'comparison' | 'problem-solving'

// Compare CoT vs Direct prompting
export async function compareCoTvsDirect(query: string): Promise<{...}>

// Multi-path CoT analysis
export async function performMultiPathCoT(query: string): Promise<{...}>
```

### Reasoning Templates

#### Itinerary Planning Template
```
Step 1: Analyze the user's requirements (destination, duration, interests, budget, travel style)
Step 2: Identify key constraints and preferences  
Step 3: Research relevant activities and attractions for their interests
Step 4: Consider logistics (travel time, location proximity, seasonal factors)
Step 5: Allocate activities across days for optimal flow
Step 6: Provide final structured itinerary
```

#### Budget Analysis Template
```
Step 1: Identify all cost categories (flights, accommodation, food, activities, transport, misc)
Step 2: Research typical costs for the destination and travel style
Step 3: Calculate daily expenses based on itinerary  
Step 4: Factor in seasonal pricing and regional differences
Step 5: Add contingency and provide total breakdown
Step 6: Present clear budget with justifications

export function detectCoTTaskType(query: string): 'itinerary' | 'budget' | 'recommendations' | 'comparison' | 'problem-solving' {
  const queryLower = query.toLowerCase();
  
  // Budget task indicators
  if (queryLower.includes('cost') || queryLower.includes('budget') || queryLower.includes('expensive')) {
    return 'budget';
  }
  
  // Comparison task indicators
  if (queryLower.includes('vs') || queryLower.includes('compare') || queryLower.includes('better')) {
    return 'comparison';
  }
  
  // Default logic for other types...
