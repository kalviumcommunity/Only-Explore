# Step 14: System & User Prompting (RTFC Framework) Implementation

## Overview

Step 14 implements the **RTFC Framework (Read The Full Context)** - a powerful prompt engineering approach that combines structured system and user prompts to create consistent, professional AI responses. This transforms Only Explore from unpredictable outputs to reliable, persona-driven travel recommendations with distinct AI personalities.

## What is the RTFC Framework?

RTFC Framework works by clearly separating two critical components:

- **System Prompt**: Defines WHO the AI is - its role, personality, expertise, and behavioral guidelines
- **User Prompt**: Contains WHAT the user wants - their specific request with context and format requirements

Together, they provide complete context for AI reasoning. Instead of just asking "Plan a trip to Kerala," we first establish the AI as a professional travel planner with specific expertise, then provide the detailed user request. This eliminates ambiguity and ensures consistent, high-quality responses.

## Key Features

### üìã Structured Prompt Engineering
- **Professional Persona**: Formal, structured planning for business and formal trips
- **Friendly Persona**: Casual, enthusiastic guidance for first-time travelers
- **Expert Persona**: Research-based recommendations for cultural immersion

    factors.push('Comprehensive response');
  }
  if (response.includes('Summary') || response.includes('Conclusion')) {
    factors.push('Structured conclusion');
  }

  const qualityScore = factors.length >= 5 ? 'High' : factors.length >= 3 ? 'Good' : 'Basic';
  return `${qualityScore} quality (${factors.length}/7 factors: ${factors.join(', ')})`;
}
```

```typescript
// Build contextual system prompt based on travel profile
let contextualSystemPrompt = systemPrompts.professional;

if (travelProfile.budgetRange === 'budget') {
  contextualSystemPrompt += `\n\nSPECIAL FOCUS: This traveler prefers budget-conscious options. Prioritize affordable accommodations, free activities, and money-saving tips.`;
} else if (travelProfile.budgetRange === 'luxury') {
  contextualSystemPrompt += `\n\nSPECIAL FOCUS: This traveler prefers premium experiences. Emphasize luxury accommodations, exclusive activities, and high-end dining.`;
}

if (travelProfile.interests?.length) {
  contextualSystemPrompt += `\n\nINTERESTS: Tailor recommendations for someone interested in: ${travelProfile.interests.join(', ')}.`;
