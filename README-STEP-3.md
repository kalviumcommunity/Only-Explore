## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites
- Step 1 (README) completed
- Step 2 (Embeddings) completed
- Gemini API key configured

### Environment Variables
The API key is hardcoded in the basic-chat.ts file for testing:
```typescript
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI('AIzaSyBly_i9JKks9T-G2KE_-Y9thsIYLm0mWiw');
```

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # Start the development server
```

## 🎯 API Endpoints

### Basic Chat
```bash
POST /api/chat/basic
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "What are the best places to visit in Bali?",
  "sessionId": "optional-session-id"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Bali is a paradise for travelers! Here are some must-visit places...",
  "sessionId": "chat_abc123_1234567890",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-29T10:30:00.000Z",
  "type": "text"
}
```

### Chat History
```bash
GET /api/chat/history/:sessionId
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "chat_abc123_1234567890",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the best places to visit in Bali?",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-29T10:30:00.000Z"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant", 
      "content": "Bali is a paradise for travelers...",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-29T10:30:05.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 2

```

### Test Basic Chat
```bash
GET /api/chat/test-basic
```

Tests multiple travel queries and returns results.

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Basic Chat Functionality
```bash
npm run test-basic-chat
```

This tests:
- 5 different travel queries
- Session continuity
- Chat history retrieval
- Error handling

### Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Test basic chat endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/chat/basic \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What are the best places to visit in Bali?"}'

# Test chat history
curl http://localhost:4000/api/chat/history/your-session-id

# Test basic chat
curl http://localhost:4000/api/chat/test-basic
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. Message Processing
1. User sends message via API
2. System creates or retrieves chat session
3. Message is added to session history

### 2. AI Response Generation
1. Travel-focused prompt is created
2. Message sent to Gemini AI
3. Response is generated and returned
4. AI response added to session history

### 3. Session Management
- Each conversation gets unique session ID
- Messages stored in memory (in-memory Map)
- Session continuity for multi-turn conversations
- Ready for database persistence

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User Message → API Endpoint → Session Management → AI Processing → Response
                                                      ↓
                                              Gemini AI (Travel Focused)
                                                      ↓
                                              Natural Language Response
```
