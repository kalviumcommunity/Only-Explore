## üé¨ Video Script (5-7 minutes)

### **Opening (0:00-0:30)**
"Welcome to Step 8 of Only Explore! Today I'm implementing Dynamic Prompting - the most sophisticated prompting technique where prompts adapt in real-time based on user profiles, conversation context, and live data. This transforms our AI from generic responses to truly personalized travel assistance."

### **What is Dynamic Prompting? (0:30-1:15)**
"Dynamic prompting means creating prompts that change based on context, rather than using fixed templates. Unlike our previous steps with static examples, dynamic prompts adapt to each user's profile, travel preferences, conversation history, and even real-time data like weather.

For example, a budget backpacker asking about Nepal gets completely different prompts than a luxury couple planning Tuscany - same AI, but personalized context creates tailored responses."

### **Implementation Architecture (1:15-2:30)**
"I built a comprehensive dynamic system with user profiles capturing interests, budget range, travel style, and previous destinations. Travel context includes destination, duration, weather, and season. Conversation context maintains chat history for continuity.

The system uses template placeholders like {interests}, {budgetRange}, {weather} that get filled dynamically. A ConversationContext class tracks ongoing conversations, learning user preferences automatically from their queries."

### **Live Demo - Personalization in Action (2:30-4:30)**
"Let me demonstrate with two different user personas:

First, a budget backpacker profile: adventure interests, solo travel, $800 budget for Nepal. Watch how the dynamic prompt creates adventure-focused itineraries with budget accommodations, hiking activities, and backpacker-friendly suggestions.

Now, a luxury couple: fine dining interests, romantic travel style, $5000 budget for Tuscany. The same system generates completely different prompts emphasizing wine tastings, luxury hotels, and romantic experiences.

Notice how the AI responses reflect not just the destination, but the user's complete travel profile and preferences."

### **Context-Aware Conversations (4:30-5:30)**
"Dynamic prompting excels at conversation continuity. When users say things like 'now give me food options,' the system remembers they're planning Rome and generates food-specific prompts with Roman cuisine focus.

The conversation context tracks preferences mentioned across messages - if someone mentions they like adventure sports, that preference carries forward to future recommendations. This creates natural, flowing conversations rather than disconnected exchanges."

### **Real-Time Data Integration (5:30-6:15)**
"The system integrates real-time data like weather conditions, seasonal information, and local factors. If it's raining in London, prompts automatically emphasize indoor activities. During winter in Switzerland, ski activities get prioritized.

This real-time adaptation ensures recommendations are always relevant to current conditions, making the travel advice practical and actionable."

### **Benefits for Only Explore (6:15-6:45)**
"Dynamic prompting represents the pinnacle of AI personalization:
- Every response is tailored to the specific user's profile and context
- Conversations flow naturally with memory and continuity
- Real-time data ensures practical, current recommendations  
- Learning system improves with each interaction
- Scales to handle infinite user variations automatically"

### **Closing (6:45-7:00)**
"That's Step 8 complete! Dynamic prompting transforms Only Explore into a truly intelligent, personalized travel assistant that adapts to each user's unique needs and context. We've now built a comprehensive AI system spanning all major prompting techniques. Thanks for following this complete journey from basic chat to advanced AI!"
