```

## üîç How It Works

### 1. Task Type Detection
The system automatically detects the task type using keyword analysis:
- **Itinerary**: "plan", "itinerary", "days"
- **Cuisine**: "food", "eat", "cuisine"
- **Budget**: "cost", "budget", "price"
- **Culture**: "culture", "tradition", "experience"

### 2. Example Selection
Based on the detected task type, the system selects the appropriate example:
```typescript
const example = oneShotExamples[taskType];
```

### 3. Prompt Construction
The system builds a one-shot prompt with the example:
```
You are Only Explore, an expert AI travel assistant. Follow the format and style of this example:

Example:
Input: "[example input]"
Output:
[example output]

Now answer this user question in the same detailed, structured format:
Input: "[user query]"
Output:
```

### 4. Response Generation
Gemini processes the prompt and generates a response that follows the example's format and structure.
