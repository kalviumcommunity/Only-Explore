## üîç How It Works

### 1. Enhanced Task Detection
The system uses confidence scoring to detect task types:
```typescript
const patterns = {
  itinerary: ['plan', 'itinerary', 'days', 'trip', 'visit', 'schedule', 'agenda'],
  cuisine: ['food', 'eat', 'cuisine', 'dish', 'restaurant', 'taste', 'try', 'cooking'],
  budget: ['cost', 'budget', 'price', 'money', 'expensive', 'cheap', 'spend'],
  culture: ['culture', 'tradition', 'custom', 'experience', 'local', 'people', 'lifestyle']
};
```

### 2. Multiple Example Selection
Based on the detected task type, the system selects all 3 examples:
```typescript
const examples = multiShotExamples[task.type]; // Returns 3 examples
```

### 3. Multi-Shot Prompt Construction
The system builds a comprehensive prompt with all examples:
```
You are Only Explore, an expert AI travel assistant. Follow the format and style of these examples:

Example 1:
Input: "[example 1 input]"
Output:
[example 1 output]

Example 2:
Input: "[example 2 input]"
Output:
[example 2 output]

Example 3:
Input: "[example 3 input]"
Output:
[example 3 output]

Now answer this user question in the same detailed, structured format:
Input: "[user query]"
Output:
```

### 4. Pattern-Based Response Generation
Gemini processes the prompt and generates a response that follows the established patterns from all examples.
